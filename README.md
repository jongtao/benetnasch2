benetnasch2
===========
Benetnasch2 is a basic platformer engine written in C++/SDL.

It uses a form of component instance list based entity management and a system function pointer list to avoid the need for a gamestate manager.

Collision between one character and the world is currently implemented, where the world is a collection of AABBs.
